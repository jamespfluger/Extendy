# Extendy
A simple C# library for various extension methods

---


### What is this?
It is a small, but useful library containing many extension methods that I have, at one point or another, found myself in need of.

### Can I contribute?
Absolutely! Open an issue up and we'll discuss your proposal. I don't want this repo to become bloated with too many methods. They are meant to be practical and used often. More niche ones can be found elsewhere or written into your project.

### Why shouldn't I just write them into my own project?
That's a completely valid alternative. I prefer using a NuGet package for methods that I use constantly.
